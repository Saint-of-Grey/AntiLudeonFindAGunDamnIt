    <description>I just want my pawns to find a dang weapon and not ask me about it, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE A HUNTER.
        That alert makes me so mad when they are standing on a bow.

        How this mod works ?
        eXtend job giver for getting a weapon from JobGiver_PickUpOpportunisticWeapon
        A patch for Thought Tree for the job driver
        Conditional Checks for the thought tree
